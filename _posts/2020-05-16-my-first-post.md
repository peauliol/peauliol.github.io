Finally got around putting this old plan of having a personal website together. It all started with [github pages](https://pages.github.com/), powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I finally have something running. It was a lot easier than I thought it would be. The challenge now is to keep it updated and alive.
